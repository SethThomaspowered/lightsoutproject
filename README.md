# Lights Out Project
Using  Test Driven Design to recreate the classic game Lights Out

For my Javascript course, I am challenging myself to use test driven design to build out the game Lights Out.

## User Stories

- A first time player should have clear instructions on how to play the game.
- A player should be able to reset the gameboard.
- A player should know how many moves they have made.
- A player should know when they have won.
- A player should be able to see how long it takes them to solve the puzzle.
- A player should be able to change the level of difficulty.

## Javascript requirements
- Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app
- Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)
- Post to an external API and show that it has saved/persisted
Example: Use Amazon S3’s API to upload a file to an AWS S3 bucket
- Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that it’s being saved/persisted
- Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application
- Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value
- Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
- Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
- Create 3 or more unit tests for your application (and document how to run them)
- Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
- Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
- Other features can be added to this list with mentor or staff permission, but we want to see you stretch your skills, so you’ll want to pick something challenging.

Additional Features you can include but may not be covered by videos/tutorials:
- Implement a drag-and-drop interface that allows the user to move elements or items on the page around (reference). For example, drag a file or image into the app from your desktop and have it display. 
- Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, Vue, etc.
- Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS
